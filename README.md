# Solana Prediction Dashboard

Minute-level Solana forecasting with three complementary models that update continuously as new prices arrive.

## Models

- **SGD Regressor** – linear model trained on price deltas with feature scaling and partial-fit support for fast adaptation.
- **Passive-Aggressive Regressor** – reacts aggressively to regime shifts while keeping updates lightweight.
- **River Linear Regression** – online learner from the River library, tuned with a low learning rate (0.001) and multiple passes per batch for stability.

All pipelines forecast the next-minute close (`target_price_1min`) and persist their state under `artifacts/models/<model_name>/` so they can pick up where they left off.

## Data flow

1. `streamlit_app/data_pipeline.py` pulls the last 240 minutes from CryptoCompare, aligns missing candles, and builds a rich feature set (moving averages, MACD, RSI, Bollinger bands, volatility metrics, price position indicators, etc.).
2. Training targets are generated by shifting prices forward one minute; additional horizons (5 min, 1 h, 24 h) are prepared for experimentation.
3. `streamlit_app/model_manager.py` loads the trained pipelines, computes predictions aligned to the correct future timestamp, and maintains live error metrics (MAE, RMSE, R², MAPE).

## Incremental learning

- `SGDRegressorPipeline` and `PassiveAggressivePipeline` use `partial_fit` to incorporate freshly fetched rows with minimal downtime.
- `RiverLinearPipeline` streams updates through River’s `learn_one`, supporting true online learning without retraining from scratch.
- `ModelManager.update_with_new_data` coordinates these updates and returns the latest metrics snapshot for monitoring.
